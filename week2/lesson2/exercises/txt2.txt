Just in time for changing seasons, the online community observatory Slooh will host a live view of the sun and discuss the aurora borealis today (March 19) in a webcast celebrating the earliest northern spring since 1896.

Starting at 5 p.m. EDT Saturday, March 19, Slooh and The Old Farmer's Almanac will provide views from the Prescott Observatory in Arizona and the "spectacle of the aurora borealis from northern latitudes," Slooh representatives wrote in a statement. You can watch the webcast live on Slooh.The webcast will also visible at Space.com, courtesy of Slooh.

"Thanks to some Leap Day weirdness this year, we're in for the earliest arrival of spring since 1896," said Slooh astronomer Paul Cox in the same statement.

"Vernal equinox usually occurs on March 21st, but this year, depending on your time zone, it falls on March 19 or 20. That's great for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, but it also marks an early start to winter for those in the Southern Hemisphere."
